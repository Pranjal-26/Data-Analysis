# Data-Analysis
How to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

1) Importing Datasets
2) Cleaning the Data
3) Data frame manipulation
4) Summarizing the Data
5) Building machine learning Regression models
6) Building data pipelines

Data Analysis libraries: To use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. Introduction to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then, another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
